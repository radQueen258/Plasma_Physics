# 🔥 Heat Insulation Comparison (Java)  
*"Because thermodynamics can be cute too!"* ✨  

## 🌟 About  
This Java program compares heat distribution in walls with different insulation configurations using both implicit and explicit numerical schemes. Perfect for physics lovers who want pretty thermal analysis!  

## 🛠 How It Works  
1. **Two Test Cases**:
   - `Inside Insulation` - fluffy insulation on the inner wall ❄️  
   - `Outside Insulation` - cozy insulation on the outer wall 🔥  

2. **Numerical Magic**:
   - Solves heat equations using matrix methods  
   - Outputs CSV files at key time intervals  

## 🚀 Run It Yourself  
```bash
javac HeatConduction.java
java HeatConduction

javac Main.java
java Main
```

## 📂 Output  
Generates CSV files named:  
- `results_[time].csv`  
For your convenience I advise that you rename them like I did so you can better use along with the Python code here:
